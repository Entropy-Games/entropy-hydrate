                the 'bind-persist' attribute will save the value of the input in
                local storage, which then gets loaded when the page is reloaded.
                Note that this data is now available to every page, as it is simply
                in the global localStorage context, however it won't override
                `localStorage.name`, it is stored in a global 'reservoir' key.
